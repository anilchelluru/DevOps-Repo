shiva Ansible roles:

In Ansible, the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier to reuse

A role directory structure contains directories/components: defaults, vars, tasks, files, templates, meta, handlers. Each directory must contain a main.yml file.

defaults: contains default variables for the role. Variables in default have the lowest priority so they are easy to override.

vars: contains variables for the role. Variables in vars have higher priority than variables in defaults directory.

tasks: contains the main steps to be executed

files: contains files which we want to be copied to the remote host. 

templates: contains file template

meta: contains metadata of role like an author, support platforms, dependencies.

handlers: contains handlers which can be invoked by “notify” directives and are associated with service.
