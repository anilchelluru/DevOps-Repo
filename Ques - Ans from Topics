shiva 16)  What is a proxy server or forward proxy ?
A proxy server is a server that routes traffic between client and system, usually external to the network, convert and mask client IP addresses, enforce security protocols, and block unknown traffic

shiva What is a reverse proxy?
a reverse proxy is used to protect servers. A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from a client, forwards the request to another one of many other servers, and returns the results from the server that actually processed the request to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request itself. The client only communicates directly with the reverse proxy server and it does not know that some other server actually processed its request.
